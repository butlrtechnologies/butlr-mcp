## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- `butlr_list_tags` — discover the tag vocabulary in an org with per-level usage counts (`applied_to: { rooms, zones, floors }`). Supports `name_contains` substring filter and `min_usage` threshold. Tags are sorted by total usage descending. (Spot-level tags exist in the data model but are not surfaced by this tool.)
- `butlr_available_rooms` response now includes a structured `unknown_tags` field listing any supplied tag names that did not resolve, so consumers can react programmatically without parsing the prose `warning`.

### Fixed
- `butlr_available_rooms` tag filter — the `roomsByTag` query was sending tag names as `tags`, but the API requires tag IDs as `tagIDs`. The tool now resolves tag names to IDs (case-insensitive) via the `tags` query before calling `roomsByTag(tagIDs:)`. The `roomsByTag` response is now correctly unwrapped from its `data` wrapper.
- `butlr_available_rooms` no longer silently relaxes AND semantics when one of the supplied tag names is unknown. Under `tag_match='all'` (the default), an unresolved tag short-circuits to an empty result with a clear error; only `tag_match='any'` continues with the resolved subset and a soft warning.
- Backend GraphQL errors returned via Apollo's `errorPolicy:'all'` are now surfaced as MCP `AUTH_EXPIRED` / `RATE_LIMITED` / `INTERNAL_ERROR` errors instead of being silently coerced into empty result sets.
- Unexpected response shapes from `roomsByTag` and `sites` queries now raise an MCP `INTERNAL_ERROR` (retryable) instead of a generic `Error`.

### Changed
- `butlr_available_rooms` accepts a new `tag_match` arg (`"all"` default, or `"any"`) controlling multi-tag semantics. Maps to the GraphQL `useOR` parameter.
- Introduced branded `TagId` / `TagName` types at the tag-resolution boundary so the API's name-vs-id distinction is enforced at compile time.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Switch npm publish to OIDC trusted publishing — removes NPM_TOKEN secret in favor of GitHub Actions identity verification
- Re-enable `--provenance` flag for cryptographic build attestation now that the repo is public
- Add `npm-publish` GitHub environment with team reviewer gate for deployment protection

### Improved
- Add "When NOT to Use" negative guidance to all 10 tool descriptions for better LLM tool routing
- Replace non-null assertions (`!`) with safe type narrowing via local variables in tool code

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Replace `undici` with built-in `fetch()` — lowers Node.js requirement from 20 to 18
- Remove `BUTLR_ORG_ID` from required env vars
- Update Claude Code setup docs to use `-e` flags for env vars
- Expand "Getting API Credentials" with self-service instructions for app.butlr.io

### Added
- `llms.txt` for LLM-assisted installation
