# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- `butlr_list_tags` — discover the tag vocabulary in an org with per-level usage counts (`applied_to: { rooms, zones, floors }`). Supports `name_contains` substring filter and `min_usage` threshold. Tags are sorted by total usage descending. (Spot-level tags exist in the data model but are not yet surfaced.)

### Fixed
- `butlr_available_rooms` tag filter — the `roomsByTag` query was sending tag names as `tags`, but the API requires tag IDs as `tagIDs`. The tool now resolves tag names to IDs (case-insensitive) via the `tags` query before calling `roomsByTag(tagIDs:)`. Unknown tag names produce a clear warning pointing users to `butlr_list_tags`. The `roomsByTag` response is now correctly unwrapped from its `Rooms.data` wrapper.

### Changed
- `butlr_available_rooms` accepts a new `tag_match` arg (`"all"` default, or `"any"`) controlling multi-tag semantics. Maps to the GraphQL `useOR` parameter.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Switch npm publish to OIDC trusted publishing — removes NPM_TOKEN secret in favor of GitHub Actions identity verification
- Re-enable `--provenance` flag for cryptographic build attestation now that the repo is public
- Add `npm-publish` GitHub environment with team reviewer gate for deployment protection

### Improved
- Add "When NOT to Use" negative guidance to all 10 tool descriptions for better LLM tool routing
- Replace non-null assertions (`!`) with safe type narrowing via local variables in tool code

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Replace `undici` with built-in `fetch()` — lowers Node.js requirement from 20 to 18
- Remove `BUTLR_ORG_ID` from required env vars
- Update Claude Code setup docs to use `-e` flags for env vars
- Expand "Getting API Credentials" with self-service instructions for app.butlr.io

### Added
- `llms.txt` for LLM-assisted installation
